- ✅ **Embedded database** (sled) for fast local storage
- ✅ **Optimized builds** with LTO and minimal binary size
- ✅ **Memory efficiency** designed for <25MB RSS
- ✅ **Sub-50ms cold start** target architecture

### User Experience
- ✅ **Rich terminal UI** with colors and Unicode icons
- ✅ **Command history** with search functionality
- ✅ **Context files** for personalized AI behavior
- ✅ **Help system** with examples and documentation
- ✅ **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- ✅ **Configuration management** commands

### Development & Distribution
- ✅ **Complete CI/CD** with GitHub Actions
- ✅ **Cross-compilation** for Apple Silicon and Intel
- ✅ **Universal binary** creation
- ✅ **Security auditing** in CI pipeline
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** framework
- ✅ **Documentation** with examples and API docs

## 🏗️ Technical Architecture

### Module Design
Each module has a single responsibility and clean interfaces:

- **Config**: Handles all configuration, environment detection, and Keychain integration
- **OpenAI**: Manages API communication with retry logic and response parsing
- **Safety**: Implements the safety validation system with regex and AST analysis
- **Executor**: Handles async command execution with proper timeout and stream handling
- **History**: Manages persistent storage of command history with search capabilities
- **Context**: Builds dynamic context from files, environment, and previous commands
- **REPL**: Provides the interactive user interface with rich terminal features
- **Telemetry**: Optional privacy-focused usage analytics

### Safety System
The safety system implements a three-tier approach:

1. **Blocked**: Extremely dangerous commands (fork bombs, rm -rf /, etc.)
2. **Confirmation**: Potentially harmful commands (sudo, system modifications)
3. **Auto-execute**: Safe read-only commands (ls, ps, find, etc.)

### Performance Optimizations
- Static linking with Link Time Optimization (LTO)
- HTTP/2 connection reuse for API calls
- Async I/O prevents blocking on file operations
- Embedded database eliminates external dependencies
- Efficient string processing and minimal allocations

## 🔧 Build & Installation

### Prerequisites
```bash
# Install Rust (if not already installed)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
source ~/.cargo/env

# Add Apple Silicon target
rustup target add aarch64-apple-darwin
```

### Build Commands
```bash
# Development build
make build

# Optimized release build
make release

# Install system-wide
make install

# Run tests
make test

# Code quality checks
make check
```

### Usage Examples
```bash
# Set up API key
commandgpt config set-key

# Interactive mode
commandgpt

# One-shot commands
commandgpt "find all large files in Downloads"
commandgpt "compress this directory"
commandgpt "show me running processes"

# With options
commandgpt --force "sudo systemctl restart nginx"
commandgpt --no-context "list directory contents"
```

## 📊 Performance Targets

| Metric | Target | Implementation |
|--------|--------|----------------|
| Cold start | ≤50ms | Optimized binary with minimal deps |
| Memory usage | ≤25MB | Efficient data structures, no GC |
| Binary size | ≤10MB | LTO, strip symbols, minimal features |
| API latency | ≤2s | HTTP/2 keep-alive, async I/O |

## 🛡️ Security Features

### API Key Management
- Stored securely in macOS Keychain
- Environment variable override for CI
- No plaintext storage on disk
- Automatic key rotation support

### Command Safety
- Static pattern matching for known dangerous commands
- Shell AST parsing to detect obfuscated commands
- User confirmation for system-altering operations
- Force flag system for advanced users

### Privacy Protection
- Minimal data sent to OpenAI (only user text + basic context)
- Secret detection and redaction in logs
- Optional telemetry with hash-based anonymization
- Local command history with configurable retention

## 🔮 Future Roadmap

The architecture is designed to support planned extensions:

### v1.1 Features
- Plugin system for custom safety rules
- Bash and fish shell support
- Enhanced context from git repositories

### v1.2 Features  
- Native SwiftUI menubar application
- Local model fallback with llama.cpp
- Team collaboration features

### v2.0 Features
- Multi-language support
- Advanced telemetry dashboard
- Model fine-tuning capabilities

## 🧪 Testing

The project includes comprehensive tests:

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Test specific modules
cargo test safety
cargo test executor
cargo test history

# Integration tests
cargo test --test integration
```

## 📝 Configuration

### System Prompt Customization
Edit `~/.commandgpt/system.md` to customize AI behavior:

```markdown
# Custom Instructions
- Always use verbose flags for clarity
- Prefer modern tools (fd over find, rg over grep)
- Include safety explanations for complex commands
```

### Context Files
Add `.md` files to `~/.commandgpt/context/` for additional context:

```markdown
# Project Context
Currently working on a React.js application with:
- TypeScript for type safety
- Docker for development environment
- PostgreSQL database
```

## 🚀 Ready for Production
