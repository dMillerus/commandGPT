# CommandGPT Comprehensive Error Handling Enhancement

## Overview

The CommandGPT shell hook has been significantly enhanced to provide comprehensive AI-powered assistance for **all command errors**, not just "command not found" scenarios. This creates a real-time assistance system that intercepts every command failure and provides intelligent suggestions.

    - Credential reset guidance
    - Alternative auth methods

11. **Timeout Errors** (operation timeouts)
    - Retry suggestions with timeouts
    - Alternative approaches
    - Network optimization

### 🔧 Shell Hook Integration

The enhanced hook system uses multiple integration points:

#### 1. `command_not_found_handler` (Traditional)
```bash
# Handles unknown commands (exit 127)
command_not_found_handler() {
    # Enhanced with comprehensive context gathering
}
```

#### 2. `preexec` Hook (Proactive)
```bash
# Runs before command execution
preexec_commandgpt_hook() {
    # Offers proactive suggestions for potentially problematic commands
}
```

#### 3. `precmd` Hook (Reactive)
```bash
# Runs after command completion
precmd_commandgpt_hook() {
    # Analyzes exit codes and provides assistance for failures
}
```

### 📊 Enhanced Context Collection

The system now gathers comprehensive context for better AI assistance:

```bash
# Error Context
--exit-code 2                           # Command exit code
--error-type "syntax_error"             # Classified error type
--stderr-output "invalid option: -xyz"  # Error output
--stdout-output "..."                   # Standard output (if any)

# Environment Context  
--pwd "/current/directory"              # Working directory
--user "username@hostname"              # User context
--command-duration 1500                 # Execution time (ms)
--environment-vars "PATH=...; SHELL=..."# Relevant env vars

# Historical Context
--last-command "git status"             # Previous command
--recent-similar "git commit"           # Recent similar commands
```

### 🚀 Usage Examples

#### Traditional Command Not Found
```bash
$ lss
🤖 Command 'lss' not found. Getting AI assistance...
💡 Suggested command:
  ls -la
📝 Analysis: 'lss' appears to be a typo of 'ls'. The suggested command lists files in long format with hidden files.
Execute this fix? [y/N]: y
```

#### File Permission Error
```bash
$ cat /etc/shadow
🤖 Command failed with exit code 1. Getting AI assistance...
❌ Command failed with exit code 1
📝 Analysis: Permission denied when trying to read /etc/shadow. This file contains password hashes and requires root access.
💡 Suggested fix:
  sudo cat /etc/shadow
⚠️  Warning: This command requires administrator privileges
Are you sure you want to execute this? [y/N]: y
```

#### Syntax Error
```bash
$ git commit -xyz
🤖 Command failed with exit code 1. Getting AI assistance...
❌ Command failed with exit code 1
📝 Analysis: Invalid option '-xyz' for git commit. Common commit options are -m (message), -a (all), --amend.
💡 Suggested fix:
  git commit -m "your commit message"
Execute this fix? [y/N]: y
```

#### Network Error
```bash
$ curl http://nonexistent.invalid
🤖 Command failed with exit code 6. Getting AI assistance...
❌ Command failed with exit code 6
📝 Analysis: DNS resolution failed for 'nonexistent.invalid'. This could be a typo in the domain name or network connectivity issue.
💡 Suggested fix:
  curl -I google.com  # Test basic connectivity first
Execute this fix? [y/N]: y
```

### 🛠️ Installation & Configuration

#### 1. Install the Enhanced Hook
```bash
commandgpt shell-hook install

commandgpt shell-hook test
```

### ⚙️ Configuration Options

The hook system supports various configuration options:

```bash
# Basic control
commandgpt-hook-on          # Enable comprehensive assistance
commandgpt-hook-off         # Disable hook
commandgpt-hook-status      # Show current status

# Help and information
commandgpt-hook-help        # Show detailed help
```

### 🔒 Safety Features

- **Smart filtering**: Dangerous commands are blocked or require confirmation
- **Timeout protection**: API calls timeout after 30 seconds to prevent hanging
- **Recursive protection**: Prevents infinite loops during hook execution
