## Installation

### From Source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourorg/commandgpt
cd commandgpt
make release
make install
```

### Using Cargo

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/yourorg/commandgpt
```

### Homebrew (Coming Soon)

```bash
brew install commandgpt
```

## Quick Start

1. **Set your OpenAI API key:**

```bash
commandgpt config set-key
```

2. **Start the interactive mode:**

```bash
commandgpt
```

3. **Ask for commands in natural language:**

```text
ü§ñ > find all large files in my home directory
üí° Suggested command:
find ~ -type f -size +100M -exec ls -lh {} +

üìù Find files larger than 100MB in home directory
Execute this command? [y/N]: y
```

## Usage

### Interactive Mode

```bash
commandgpt
```

Special commands in interactive mode:
- `help` - Show available commands
- `history [N]` - Show last N commands (default: 20)  
- `search <query>` - Search command history
- `clear` - Clear screen
- `exit` - Exit the program

### One-shot Mode

```bash
commandgpt "compress all images in this folder"
commandgpt "show me disk usage for each directory"
commandgpt "kill all processes containing 'node'"
```

### Configuration Management

```bash
# Set API key securely in Keychain
commandgpt config set-key

# Delete stored API key
commandgpt config delete-key

# Show current configuration
commandgpt config show
```

### Shell Hook - Intelligent Auto-Fallback

CommandGPT includes an advanced shell hook system that provides AI assistance for all command failures:

```bash
# Install and enable shell hook
commandgpt shell-hook install
commandgpt shell-hook enable
```

**Comprehensive Error Handling** - Not just "command not found":

- ‚úÖ Unknown commands and typos
- ‚úÖ Permission denied errors  
- ‚úÖ File/directory not found
- ‚úÖ Syntax errors and invalid flags
- ‚úÖ Network connectivity issues
- ‚úÖ Missing dependencies and packages

Example usage:

```bash
$ lss
ü§ñ Command 'lss' not found. Getting AI assistance...
üí° Suggested command: ls -la

$ curl invalid-domain.test
ü§ñ Command failed (exit 6). Getting AI assistance...  
üí° Suggested fix: curl -I google.com  # Test connectivity first
```

**Safety Features:**

- üîí Disabled by default for security
- üõ°Ô∏è Multi-layer safety validation
- ‚è±Ô∏è 30-second timeout protection
- ‚úã Always requires user confirmation

For complete shell hook documentation, see [SHELL_HOOK.md](SHELL_HOOK.md).

### Command Line Options

```bash
commandgpt [OPTIONS] [REQUEST]

Options:
  -d, --debug           Enable debug logging
      --force           Force execution without safety checks  
      --always-confirm  Always confirm commands even if auto_execute is true
      --no-context      Disable context inclusion
  -h, --help           Print help
  -V, --version        Print version
```

## Safety Features

commandGPT includes multiple layers of safety protection:

### Automatic Detection
- **Destructive commands**: `rm -rf`, `dd`, `mkfs`, etc.
- **System modifications**: `sudo` operations, service management
- **Network risks**: Piping remote scripts to shell
- **Privilege escalation**: `chmod`, `chown` on system directories

### Safety Actions
- üö´ **Blocked**: Extremely dangerous commands are refused
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Confirmation**: Potentially harmful commands require explicit approval
- ‚úÖ **Auto-execute**: Safe read-only commands can run automatically

### Override Options
- Use `--force` flag to convert blocked commands to confirmation-required
- Commands are validated even with force flag enabled

## Configuration

Configuration files are stored in `~/.commandgpt/`:

```text
~/.commandgpt/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ system.md          # Custom system prompt additions
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ context/           # Additional context files
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ development.md # Example context file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ history.db         # Command history database
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ telemetry.txt      # Telemetry preference (optional)
```

### Custom System Prompt

Edit `~/.commandgpt/system.md` to customize the AI's behavior:

```markdown
# Custom Instructions

## Preferences
- Always use long-form flags for clarity
- Prefer `fd` over `find` when available
- Include explanations for complex commands

## Environment
- Current project: React.js web application
- Using Docker for development
- Database: PostgreSQL
```

### Context Files

Add `.md` files to `~/.commandgpt/context/` to provide additional context:

```markdown
# Project Context

## Current Task
Working on user authentication system

## Technology Stack  
- Frontend: React with TypeScript
- Backend: Node.js with Express
- Database: PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM
```

## Architecture

commandGPT is built with a modular architecture optimized for performance:

### Core Modules
- **Config**: Keychain integration, environment detection
- **OpenAI**: HTTP/2 client with retry logic and response parsing
- **Safety**: Multi-layer command validation and risk assessment
- **Executor**: Async command execution with timeout handling
- **History**: Embedded database for command persistence
- **Context**: Dynamic context building from files and environment
- **REPL**: Interactive terminal interface with colored output

### Performance Optimizations
- **Static linking** with LTO for minimal binary size
- **HTTP/2 keep-alive** for reduced API latency
- **Async I/O** throughout for non-blocking operations
- **Embedded database** (sled) for fast local storage
- **Zero-copy** string processing where possible

## Security & Privacy

### API Key Storage
- Keys stored securely in macOS Keychain
- Environment variable override for CI/headless use
- No plaintext storage on disk

### Command Safety
- Static pattern matching for dangerous operations
- AST parsing to detect obfuscated commands
- User confirmation for system-altering operations

### Data Privacy
- Minimal data sent to OpenAI (user text + basic context)
- Optional telemetry with anonymized data only
- Local command history with automatic secret redaction

### Supply Chain Security
- Dependencies audited with `cargo deny`
- Reproducible builds with locked dependencies
- Code signing and notarization for distribution

## Performance Benchmarks
